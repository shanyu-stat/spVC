## Introduction

The spVC method aims to provide a flexible spatial regression model and
corresponding inference tool to elucidate the relationships between gene
expression, spatial locations, and other cell/spot-level covariates in a
streamlined approach. The spVC package is released under the GNU General
Public License version 3 license.

Any suggestions on the package are welcome! For technical problems,
please report to [Issues](https://github.com/shanyu-stat/spVC/issues).
